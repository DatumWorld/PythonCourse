Shinz≈ç Abe (born 21 September 1954) is the current Prime Minister of Japan, re-elected to the position in December 2012. Abe is also the President of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Abe served for a year as Prime Minister, from 2006 to 2007. Hailing from a politically prominent family, at age 52, Abe became Japan's youngest post-war prime minister, and the first to be born after World War II, when he was elected by a special session of the National Diet in September 2006. Abe resigned on 12 September 2007, for health reasons. Abe was replaced by Yasuo Fukuda, beginning a string of five Prime Ministers, none of whom retained office for more than sixteen months, before Abe staged a political comeback. On 26 September 2012, Abe defeated former Minister of Defense Shigeru Ishiba, in a run-off vote, to win the LDP Presidential Election. Following the LDP's landslide victory in the 2012 general election, Abe became the Prime Minister again. Abe is the first former Prime Minister to return to the office since Shigeru Yoshida in 1948. Abe was re-elected at the 2014 general election, retaining his two-thirds majority with coalition partner Komeito. On the 70th anniversary of Japan's defeat in World War II, Abe's cabinet decided to follow previous governments' position on Japan's wartime past, and included the statements of "apology", "colonization", "aggression", and "remorseful regret" to the sufferings affected during the war.
